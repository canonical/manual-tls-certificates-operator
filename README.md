# TLS Certificates Operator

This charm is used for applications requiring TLS certificates.

## Usage

### With user provided certificates

Here we use a set of certificates placed them under the working directory.

```bash
juju deploy tls-certificates-operator \
 --config certificate="$(base64 -w0 certificate.pem)" \
 --config ca-chain="$(base64 -w0 ca_chain.pem)" \
 --config ca-certificate="$(base64 -w0 ca_certificate.pem)"
juju relate tls-certificates-operator your-charm
```

### Passing user-provided certificates to requirer units manually

The following three Juju actions make it possible for the user to manually provide certificates to units of the requirer charm.

The following action will return all certificate requests that don't have certificates already provided, along with further information (relation_id, application_name and unit_name)

```bash
juju run tls-certificates-operator/leader get-outstanding-certificate-requests
```

The second action is used to get the certificate requests and their information from a specific relation by providing the relation_id as a parameter:

```bash
juju run tls-certificates-operator/leader get-certificate-request \
  relation-id=<id>
```

The third action allows the user to provide the certificates and specify the csr.
```bash
juju run tls-certificates-operator/leader provide-certificate \
  relation-id=<id> \
  certificate="$(base64 -w0 certificate.pem)" \
  ca-chain="$(base64 -w0 ca_chain.pem)" \
  ca-certificate="$(base64 -w0 ca_certificate.pem)" \
  certificate-signing-request="$(base64 -w0 csr.pem)\
```

### With self-signed certificates (deprecated)

> **Warning**: This feature is deprecated and will be dropped in the future, please use the 
> [self-signed-certificates](https://charmhub.io/self-signed-certificates) operator.

```bash
juju deploy tls-certificates-operator \
  --config generate-self-signed-certificates=true \
  --config ca-common-name=<your ca common name>
juju relate tls-certificates-operator your-charm
```

## Config

List of configuration options:
- **generate-self-signed-certificates (boolean)**: Generate self-signed certificates and ignores provided certificates.
- **ca-common-name (string)**: Certificate Authority Common Name (only use if 'generate-self-signed-certificates' is set to true).
- **certificate (string)**: Base64 encoded TLS certificate (do not use if 'generate-self-signed-certificates' is set to true).
- **ca-certificate (string)**: Base64 encoded CA Certificate (do not use if 'generate-self-signed-certificates' is set to true).
- **ca-chain (string)**: Base64 encoded CA Chain (do not use if 'generate-self-signed-certificates' is set to true).
- **ca-certificate-validity(int)**: Integer representing the number of days for which the self-signed certificates are valid (only use if 'generate-self-signed-certificates' is set to true). Its value should not be smaller than `certificate-validity`.
- **certificate-validity(int)**: Integer representing the number of days for which the self-signed certificates are valid (only use if 'generate-self-signed-certificates' is set to true). Its value should not be larger than `ca-certificate-validity`.


## Relations

This charm provides certificates using the `tls-certificates` relation.
