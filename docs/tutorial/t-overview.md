# TLS Certificates Operator tutorial
The TLS Certificates Operator charm is responsible for distributing certificates through relationships. Certificates are provided by the operator through Juju configs.

In this tutorial we will walk through how to:
- Set up an environment using [Multipass](https://multipass.run/) with [MicroK8s](https://microk8s.io/) and [Juju](https://juju.is/).
- Deploy TLS Certificates Operator using a single command.
- Configure the charm.
- Set up the relation with other charms.
