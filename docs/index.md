The TLS Certificates Operator charm is responsible for distributing x.509 certificates in contexts where certificates are obtained through a manual process.

## Usage
Deploy the charm:
```shell
juju deploy tls-certificates-operator
juju status --watch 1s
```
The deployment of the charm is completed when its status is in `Active/Idle` state.

At this point you can relate the TLS Certificates Operator to a requirer of TLS certificates through the `tls-certificates` interface:
```shell
juju relate tls-certificates-operator <your-charm>
```
